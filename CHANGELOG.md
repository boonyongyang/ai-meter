# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.6.2] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- Claude login white-screen on the Google sign-in popup. Google's "embedded user agent" gate inspects JS surface beyond the UA string — `navigator.webdriver`, an empty `navigator.plugins`, and missing `navigator.languages`. We now inject a stealth `WKUserScript` at document-start (in all frames, on both the parent and popup configs) that masks those signals. The Safari `customUserAgent` already in place is unchanged

## [2.6.1] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed

- OAuth refresh dedup race in `CodexOAuthService`. Cleanup of the in-flight refresh task slot moved from the outer awaiter's continuation into the `Task` body via `defer`, so the dict slot is cleared exactly once and atomically with task completion. Closes a window where a late awaiter's cleanup could clobber a freshly-stored later task, allowing two concurrent `/oauth/token` POSTs and Auth0 family-revoke

## [2.6.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- Tap-to-refresh on Copilot monthly quota and Codex window telemetry hero cards. Cards become real SwiftUI buttons with rounded hit targets, accessibility labels, and the same refresh action as the footer button (#8)

### Fixed

- Footer refresh tooltips on Copilot and Codex tabs no longer claim a `(⌘R)` keyboard shortcut that was never bound (#9)

## [2.5.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- **Per-folder Claude account routing.** New Settings → Claude Routing tab lets you maintain multiple Claude OAuth profiles (`personal`, `work`, etc.), paste tokens once into the macOS Keychain, then map folders to profiles. AIMeter writes managed `.envrc` blocks that direnv consumes at runtime to set `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` per-directory. Setup-time only — no runtime shimming, no proxy
- `ClaudeProfile` + `ClaudeFolderRoute` data model with JSON persistence to `~/Library/Application Support/AIMeter/claude-routing.json`
- `ClaudeProfileKeychain` — discrete per-slug Keychain entries (service ID `claude-<slug>`) with `kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlock` for security-scoped access
- `EnvrcWriter` — block-marker merge (`# >>> aimeter claude routing >>>` … `# <<< aimeter claude routing <<<`) preserves user's existing `.envrc` lines; atomic writes via `FileManager.replaceItem`
- Diff preview sheet with create/update/delete actions, GitHub-style colored line gutters, horizontal scroll for long shell lines, and content-hugging height (no more huge top/bottom gaps on short diffs)
- Onboarding card for first-time setup; cascade-delete confirmation when removing a profile that has folder rules pointing at it
- Token rotation flow with copy-command buttons for the three-step rotate process
- Pre-write info banner explaining the `direnv allow` step users will need to run once per `.envrc`

### Fixed

- Diff preview no longer persists a folder rule when the user clicks Cancel — route persistence is now deferred into a `commit` closure that only fires after `EnvrcWriter.commit()` succeeds
- "Add Folder Rule" button correctly disabled (with tooltip) until at least one Claude profile exists
- Folder picker uses security-scoped bookmarks so the sandbox can re-resolve the folder URL across launches

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Fast PKCE OAuth sign-in wired into the Codex tab UI. Primary "Sign in with ChatGPT" button, "Add Account" menu item, and token-expired banner re-auth now open the system browser → `localhost:1455` callback → keychain — no more WKWebView spinner on the happy path
- "Trouble signing in?" fallback link surfaces below the primary button when PKCE fails, preserving the WKWebView path as a safety net
- New `CodexOAuthError.callbackServerBindFailed(underlying:)` distinguishes non-port bind failures from `EADDRINUSE`

### Changed

- `CodexOAuthService.startLogin` split into `performLoginFlow` (returns tokens) + `saveOAuthTokens` (persists). Caller picks the canonical accountID after decoding the email claim — no more brittle `pending_oauth_login` rekey
- Callback server now binds before opening the browser, closing a startup race where a fast redirect could beat the listener
- `accountMismatch` is now a logged warning instead of a hard throw — same-email plan/org changes no longer block re-auth

### Fixed

- Proxy bearer + `reloadAccount` now fall back to `.oauthAccessTokenCache` when the legacy `.accessToken` slot is empty. The proactive token warden's refreshes are finally observable to the network layer (v2.3.0 latent bug)
- Callback server uses async NIO `.get()` and `shutdownGracefully()` instead of `.wait()` / `syncShutdownGracefully()` — no more blocking calls on the main actor
- Cancelling a pending OAuth login now surfaces as `.cancelled` instead of `.invalidTokenResponse`

## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Proactive Codex token refresh: tokens self-renew at `expiresAt − 5min` per OAuth-upgraded account, with foreground hook on app activation and exponential backoff on transient failure
- "Session expired" banner now driven by terminal refresh failure (HTTP 400 `invalid_grant` / 401), not bare expiry — OAuth-upgraded accounts no longer surface the banner during normal use

### Removed

- Claude-compat proxy (Codex → Claude routing): `ClaudeCompatProxyService` and `ClaudeProxyStore` deleted along with the routing UI in the Claude tab. Codex CLI proxy on port 2455 and Claude transcript parsing remain untouched.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- Session Telemetry card is now tappable to refresh quota, with full accessibility support (Button, VoiceOver, keyboard, tooltip)
- README screenshots showcasing quota popover, analytics window, and settings

### Changed

- Settings screenshot width normalized to 320px to prevent mobile overflow on GitHub

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- Sonnet dedicated-limit row on the Claude tab now shows the same weekly pace indicator as the overall 7-day Claude limit

### Added

- Dedicated Claude analytics window with redesigned model distribution and daily traffic panels
- Dedicated Codex analytics window with session telemetry sourced from local `~/.codex` state
- Weekly pace indicator on the Claude 7-day limit row, mirroring the 5-hour session pace

### Changed

- Major Mac-first visual redesign across the app with new telemetry-inspired surfaces, navigation, and provider presentation
- Claude quota popover rebuilt around a session hero, grouped limits, cleaner pacing signals, and a more native analytics split
- Codex popover redesigned with a provider-specific telemetry layout, slimmer status sections, and updated footer treatment
- MiniMax hero gauge now shows raw request counts (used / total) instead of just a percentage
- MiniMax Model Bank focuses on weekly usage, removing the redundant interval card
- Claude plan detection migrated to the bootstrap endpoint after `seat_tier` became unreliable upstream
- App icon replaced with the new owl branding

### Fixed

- Codex Analytics "unable to open database file" error when `state_5.sqlite` is in WAL mode without sidecars
- Claude pace messaging now shows the steady-pace delta again alongside the reset and runout guidance
- Release icon assets now use the updated full-background owl icon set at every macOS size

## [1.44.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- Claude Design quota card that appears automatically when `seven_day_omelette` is present in the Claude usage response

### Changed

- Claude Code model labels now use friendly names like `Opus 4.7`, `Sonnet 4.6`, and `Haiku 4.5`
- Provider number shortcuts now follow the user-defined tab order instead of the original hard-coded provider sequence
- Release automation rebuilt around stricter preflight checks, changelog-driven notes, configurable signing/repo settings, and safer dry-run behavior

### Fixed

- Claude Code model and daily usage parsing now recognizes newly launched Claude models like `claude-opus-4-7` without requiring another hardcoded model list update
- Settings shortcut reference now matches the actual provider count and uses `⌘7` for Settings when six provider tabs are present

## [1.43.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- Multi-account support for Claude, GLM, Kimi, and MiniMax with per-provider account cards in Settings

- Codex load balancing: automatic failover to next available account on 429 rate-limit or 401 unauthorized
- "Auto-switch enabled" indicator in Codex tab when multiple accounts are configured
- MiniMax quota tab: collapsible model sections with mini progress bar in header; models with active usage auto-expand on load
- opencode multi-account support: proxy now handles `/responses` and `/v1/responses` paths, routing them through the Codex load balancer for automatic account failover

### Changed

- Settings > Accounts redesigned around per-provider account management
- Key storage migrated to account-scoped patterns for Claude and API-key providers
- Codex proxy failover loop simplified to while-let pattern with natural termination
- Account state normalization batched into single dispatch for reduced main-thread churn
- MiniMax quota tab now scrollable with 60% screen-height cap to handle large model lists
